<h2>NEW WELLS FOR OLD.</h2>

<p>Over the top of Part II. of <i>The Outline
of History</i> I caught the smiling
glance of the man in the opposite
corner of the compartment.</p>

<p>"Good stuff that," he said, indicating
the History with a jerk of his head.</p>

<p>"Quite," I agreed, maintaining my
distance.</p>

<p>"Immense," he continued. "And it
means the dawn of a new life for me.
I'm <span class="sc">Wells's</span> hero. Every time I've
appeared in his half-yearly masterpiece,
ever since <i>Tono Bungay</i>. And look at
the mess he's made of my life. Often
I've had to start it under the cloud of
mysterious parentage. Invariably I
have been endowed with a Mind (capital
M). Think of those uphill fights of mine
against adverse conditions. And my
unhappy marriages. He has led me
into every variation of infidelity. When
I <i>did</i> hit it off with my wife for once,
he sent us to the Arctic regions as a
punishment. In the depth of winter,
too.</p>

<p>But, now he's taken up this History,
I'm free. The dam has burst and strange
things come floating down ..."</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet in his excitement.
He was wearing a loose-fitting
suit and what his master might call a
lower middle-class hat.</p>

<p>"And now I'm going to do all the
things I've always wanted to do. A
happy marriage; well-ordered life in the
suburbs; warm slippers in the fender,
and all that that stands for; kinemas,
perhaps, and bowls. An allotment ..."</p>

<p>"But," I objected, "this History won't
occupy him for ever. There should be
only about sixteen more parts. He'll
have you out again next autumn."</p>

<p>"But <span class="sc">Wells</span> is getting the Suburban
idea too." He was standing right over
me, glaring horribly with excitement.
The train had entered a tunnel and he
was shouting bravely against the din.
"Look in Part I. He acknowledges the
help he has received from Mrs. <span class="sc">Wells</span>.
And her watchful criticism. That from
<i>him</i>! I tell you I am free&mdash;free!"</p>

<p>He was shaking me by the shoulders
now, his face close to mine. "I shall
have my allotment. Prize parsnips&mdash;giant
marrows!"</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure," I yelled&mdash;the
tunnel seemed endless. "Remember
poor old <i>Sherlock</i>. <span class="sc">Doyle</span> raised <i>him</i>
from the dead. And you"&mdash;my voice
rising to a scream&mdash;"he'll have you
out&mdash;out&mdash;<span class="sc">out</span>!"</p>
<p class="center" style="font-size: 1.4em;">

<p>As I came to I heard my dentist remark
to the doctor that I always had
been a bad patient under gas.</p>

<h3>MR. PUNCH ON SILK STOCKINGS.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;Your article about
Christmas presents was a great success.
I took your advice about the silk stockings,
and sent the following verses with
them, which some of your married
readers may care to cut out and keep
for future use:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Your stockings once, on Christmas Eve,</p>
<p class="i2">Would hang, your cot adorning,</p>
<p>And Father Christmas, we believe,</p>
<p class="i2">Would fill them ere the morning;</p>
<p>But since he spied your dainty toes</p>
<p class="i2">To exchange the parts he's willing:</p>
<p>He thinks it's his to send the hose</p>
<p class="i2">And yours to find the filling.</p>
<p>He lays his offerings at your feet</p>
<p class="i2">And hopes you won't deride them,</p>
<p>For he has nothing half so neat</p>
<p class="i2">As you to put inside them.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>There! I can only repeat that the
results were excellent, and express my
gratitude to you for the same.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i20">Yours obediently,</p>
<p class="i28"><span class="sc">Grateful Husband.</span></p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>P.S.&mdash;The ties I got this time were
quite all right; she too must have
read your article.</p>

<h3>NATURE AND ART.</h3>

<h4><i>To Betty, who can afford to defy the laws of symmetry.</i></h4>

<blockquote><p>
[Being reflections on the old theory, recently developed before the
Hellenic Society by Mr. <span class="sc">Jay Hambridge</span>, that certain formul&aelig; of
proportions found in nature&mdash;notably in the normal ratio between a
man's height and the span of his outstretched arms (2 : &radic;5)&mdash;constituted
the basis of symmetry in the art of the Greeks and, earlier, of
the Egyptians.]
</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Betty, I fear you don't conform</p>
<p>Precisely to the female norm</p>
<p class="i2">From dainty foot to charming noddle,</p>
<p>But, closely measured, span by span,</p>
<p>Seem built upon a private plan</p>
<p>Not found in <span class="sc">Annie Kellerman</span></p>
<p class="i2">Or in the well-known Melos model.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>If you compare your width and height&mdash;</p>
<p>Arms horizontal, left and right&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">With ancient types of pure perfection,</p>
<p>The ratio may not, it's true,</p>
<p>Be as the root of 5 to 2,</p>
<p>But what, my dear, has that to do</p>
<p class="i2">With laws of natural selection?</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Let Mr. <span class="sc">Hambridge</span> to your shape</p>
<p>Apply his T-square and his tape,</p>
<p class="i2">And wish that you were more archaic;</p>
<p>Why should I care? I love you best</p>
<p>For what no compasses can test,</p>
<p>For graces not to be expressed</p>
<p class="i2">In terms however algebraic.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I love you for the lips and eyes</p>
<p>That none may hope to standardize</p>
<p class="i2">On any system known to Hellas;</p>
<p>And what I like about your smile</p>
<p>Has no relation to the style</p>
<p>Of any pyramid of Nile</p>
<p class="i2">Figured by mathematic fellahs.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Though your proportions mayn't agree</p>
<p>With <span class="sc">Fechner's</span> pedant formul&aelig;,</p>
<p class="i2">I don't complain of such disparity;</p>
<p>Too flawless that perfection shows;</p>
<p>For me a larger comfort flows</p>
<p>From human failings (take your nose&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">I like its quaint irregularity).</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Indeed I love you best of all</p>
<p>For those defects by which you fall</p>
<p class="i2">Short of the pattern you should follow;</p>
<p>As I would fain be loved for mine,</p>
<p>Speaking as one whose own design</p>
<p>Lacks something of the perfect line</p>
<p class="i2">Affected by the young Apollo.</p>

<h3>HOW TO GAIN A JOURNALISTIC POSITION.</h3>

<p>Young aspirants are always endeavouring to secure posts
on our leading newspapers, and complain bitterly that their
letters of application are ignored by obtuse editors. To
help them in this sad ambition Mr. Punch has composed
a series of letters to divers editors which he guarantees will
prove eminently satisfactory.</p>

<h4><i>To the Editor of "The Daily News."</i></h4>

<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;I regard the insufferable <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> as the
most dangerous, the most malignant, the most incompetent
politician who has ever attempted to misrule this country.
The iniquity of the Coalition will make enlightened rulers
like <span class="sc">Lenin</span> and <span class="sc">Trotsky</span> blush for the human race. I feel
with you that till the real Liberal party returns to power
England will never know peace and prosperity. Then and
then only will brotherly friendship between England and
Germany be renewed. Then and then only shall we see
cheap milk, cheap coal, abundant housing, the Free Breakfast
Table and the Large Cocoa Cup. To show my devotion
to the cause you so nobly advocate I may say that I have
actually read every article contributed by Mr. <span class="sc">Masterman</span>
to your paper. I am strongly in favour of an <i>entente</i> with
Labour, by which Labour should agree not to contest any
seats where the true Asquithians stand a chance. I enclose
as a specimen of my work the first of a series of articles on
"How <span>Lloyd George</span> lost the War," which I am sure will
be invaluable at by-elections.</p>

<h4><i>To the Editor of "The Daily Mail."</i></h4>

<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;I am young and, if possible, growing younger daily.
My motto is "Hustle and Bustle" and not "Dilly and
Dally." I live on standard bread, in a wooden hut embowered,
when feasible, with sweet peas. My ear is always
close to the ground, and I can confidently predict what the
man in the street will be thinking about the day after tomorrow.
Politically, I am opposed to the Wastrels, the
Wee Frees and the Bolsheviks, and am not prepared as yet
to back Labour unreservedly. I can express myself brightly
and briefly on any topical subject. Herewith I send specimen
articles (length three hundred words) on "Poker
Bridge," "Are we having Wetter Washdays?" and "The
Woggle-Wiggle Dance." Should there be no vacancy on
your staff I should be prepared to accept one on any other
of your publications&mdash;<i>The Weekly Dispatch</i>, <i>The Times</i> or
<i>The Rainbow</i>.</p>

<h4><i>To the Editor of "The Manchester Guardian."</i></h4>

<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;I was a Conscientious Objector during the War. I
conscientiously object to everything still, including the
Peace Treaty. I speak and write fifteen languages and
dialects, including Oxford English. I have a comprehensive
knowledge of social and political life in Continental Europe,
Asia, Africa, America and Polynesia. I have also resided in
England. I have a deep conviction that under all conditions,
everywhere and at all times, England is invariably
and absolutely in the wrong. In home politics I am resolutely
opposed to all the Coalition has done, is doing or will
do. It is my firm opinion that the actions of England
would become less deplorable, less criminal if Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span>
returned to power. I enclose as specimens of my mentality
two intensely human articles which I doubt not will find a
home in your columns: "Proportional Representation in
Jugo-Slavia" (length four thousand five hundred words) and
"Futurism under <span class="sc">Trotsky</span>" (length five thousand words).</p>

<h4><i>To the Editor of "The Spectator."</i></h4>

<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;In offering my services to you I may point out how
happily my up-bringing and mental training have fitted me
for a post on your staff. The child of an Archdeacon (who
was also honorary chaplain to a rifle club), I was born in a
house with earth-filled walls and brought up in intimate
association with a large number of most intelligent animals.
If desired I am prepared to relate anecdotes of the family
bull-dog and a pet she-goat which will verify my description.
I feel with you that England can only be saved by relying
on a Free-Trading, Non-Socialist, Church Establishment.
I loathe alike Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span> and Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span>, and
think that the intellect of England, which blossoms so luxuriously
in country rectories and deaneries, finds its best
expression in Lord <span class="sc">Hugh Cecil</span>. As a specimen of my
literary ability I enclose a middle article on "The Sense of
Obligation in Tom-Cats."</p>

<h2>A "POSITIVELY LAST" APPEARANCE.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. Punch.</span> "ACCEPT THIS POOR TRIBUTE IN RECOGNITION OF MUCH GOOD
ENTERTAINMENT
IN THE PAST. I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY ARTISTS WOULD HAVE DONE
WITHOUT YOU."</p>

<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p>It is rumoured that Professor <span class="sc">Porta</span>
has sent a message to Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd
George</span>, wishing him a Happy New
World.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Mr. Justice <span class="sc">Rowlatt</span> has decided
that photography is not a profession.
With some actresses, of course, it is
just a disease.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The gentleman who drew 1920 in a
fifty-pound sweepstake as the date of
the ex-Kaiser's trial is now prepared to
sell his chance for sixpence-halfpenny.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"He is not a politician," says Mr. <span class="sc">R.
Harcourt</span> in <i>The Times</i>, referring to
Sir <span class="sc">Auckland Geddes</span>. It will be
interesting to see how Sir <span class="sc">Auckland</span>
accepts this compliment.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A letter posted at Hull for Odessa in
July, 1914, has just been returned to the
sender. The postal authorities are
thought to take the view that the sender
should be given an opportunity of
adding a few seasonable observations
to his previous remarks.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It is all nonsense to say that there
can be no change in the present high
prices. They can always go higher.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Owing to the strike of cabmen in
Glasgow a number of people had to
walk home on New Year's Eve. It is
not said how the others got home, but
we have made a guess.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>On enquiry about the erection of
huge new premises in the Strand by
the American Bush Terminal Company,
we gather that London is not to be
removed, but will be allowed to remain
next door.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Inspector <span class="sc">Moss</span> of the Great Eastern
Railway Police has just had his pocket
picked and thirty pounds stolen. It is
only fair to say that he was in plain
clothes and the thief did not know he
was a police officer.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A history of the Ministry of Munitions
is to be compiled at a cost of

<h3>A BUNCH OF POETS.</h3>

<p>Mr. Obadiah Geek has broken his
long silence to some purpose. Those
who remember his pre-war achievements
in the field of polychromatic
romanticism will hardly be prepared
for his present development, which lifts
him at a bound from the overcrowded
ranks of lyric-writers to the uncongested
heights whereon recline the great
masters of epic poetry. And yet it was
perhaps inevitable. The thunder and
the reek of war (the last two years of
which, we believe, were spent by Mr.
Geek in the Egg Control Department)
could scarcely have failed to imprint
their mark on the author of <i>Eros in
Eruption</i>; and so he has given us a
real epic, whose very title, <i>Ad Astra</i>, is
symbolic of the high altitudes in which
he so triumphantly and so securely
navigates. Outwardly it is a story of
the War, but there is little difficulty in
probing the allegory; and those who
follow the hero's vicissitudes as a
private in the Gasoliers, right through
to his victorious advancement to the
rank of Acting Lance-Corporal, unpaid
(and there is a symbolism even in the
"unpaid"), will readily supply the
application to the affairs of everyday
life.</p>

<p>The ten thousand odd lines of this
inspired poem are liberally enlivened
with those characteristic flashes which
Mr. Geek's previous efforts have led us
to expect. Nothing could be happier
than the following, descriptive of the
hero's early days on the barrack-square:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem1">  <div class="stanza">
<p>The Sergeant rolled his eyes toward the azure</p>
<p>And called down curses on my bloody head...</p>
<p>"You buzz about," his peroration ran,</p>
<p>"Like a bluebottle in a sugar-bowl.</p>
<p>Thank God we have a Navy!" and my feet,</p>
<p>Turned outward, as they had been drilled to turn,</p>
<p>At forty-five degrees or thereabouts,</p>
<p>Itched to join issue with his swollen paunch;</p>
<p>But I refrained.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Or again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem1">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Fame, the skyscraper, hath a thousand floors;</p>
<p>And some toil slowly upward, stair by stair,</p>
<p>And stagger and halt and faint upon the way;</p>
<p>Others, more fortunate, achieve the top</p>
<p>At one swift elevation, by the lift.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Mr. Geek, whatever his method of
progression may have been, has certainly
"achieved the top"&mdash;if indeed he
has not gone over it.</p>

<p>In <i>Throbs</i>, Miss Gramercy Gingham-Potts
reveals a depth of feeling and
delicacy of expression that should
secure her the right of entry to every
art-calendar and birthday-book. Her
Muse is, perhaps, a trifle an&aelig;mic, but
to many none the less interesting on
that account; its very fragility, in fact,
constitutes its chief appeal. She has
an engaging gift of definition that,
combined with a keen appreciation of
the obvious, makes her verses <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'particlarly'">particularly</ins>
susceptible to quotation. For
instance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem1">  <div class="stanza">
<p>The maiden asked, "What is a kiss?"</p>
<p class="i6">The poet wrote:</p>
<p>"Kisses are stamps that frank with bliss</p>
<p class="i6">Love's contract-note."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>While for effectively studied simplicity
it would be difficult to match the lyrical
gem to which Miss Gingham-Potts has
given the arresting title, "Farewell":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem1">  <div class="stanza">
<p>The birds sing sweet in Summer;</p>
<p class="i2">The daisies hear their song;</p>
<p>But Winter's come, and they are dumb</p>
<p class="i10">  So long.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I told my love in Summer,</p>
<p class="i2">So pure and brave and strong;</p>
<p>But frosts came on; my love is gone;</p>
<p class="i10">  So long!</p>

<p>A new volume by the author of <i>Swings
and Roundabouts</i> is something of an
event; and in <i>Bottles and Jugs</i> Mr.
Ughtred Biggs makes another fascinating
raid on the garbage-bins of London's
underworld. Mr. Biggs is a stark realist,
and his unminced meat may prove
too strong for some stomachs; but those
who can digest the fare he offers will find
it wonderfully sustaining. Here is no
condiment of verbiage, no dressing of
the picturesque. Life is served up high,
and almost raw. By way of illustration
we cannot do better than quote
from the opening poem, "Bill's Wife,"
in which the calculated roughness of the
rhythm is redolent of the pervading
atmosphere:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem1">  <div class="stanza">
<p>At the corner of the street</p>
<p class="i2">Stands the Blue-faced Pig;</p>
<p>Outside a barrel-organ is playing</p>
<p class="i2">And the people are dancing a jig.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>A woman waits there grimly;</p>
<p class="i2">Her eyes are set and her lips drawn thin;</p>
<p>For Bill, her man, is in the public,</p>
<p class="i2">Soaking his soul in gin.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Students of sociology might do worse
than devote careful attention to these
gaunt chronicles of Slumland.</p>

<hr />

<p>The following stanzas, taken from a
poem entitled "Reconstruction," are a
favourable example of Mr. Thor Pinmoney's
somewhat unequal genius:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem1">  <div class="stanza">
<p>By strife we live, but boredom slays;</p>
<p>My mind from out this office strays</p>
<p>And takes me back to the spacious days</p>
<p class="i4">When I counted socks in Ordnance.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I hate my pen; I hate my stool;</p>
<p>What am I but a nerveless tool?</p>
<p>But we did not work by rote or rule</p>
<p class="i4">When I counted socks in Ordnance....</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>There are times even now when it really seems</p>
<p>I'm back in a suburb of shell-shocked Rheims;</p>
<p>But the office echoes my waking screams</p>
<p>When I find it was only in my dreams</p>
<p class="i4">I was counting socks in Ordnance.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Unfortunately, all Mr. Pinmoney's
efforts do not come up to this standard,
and we should be almost inclined to
wonder whether the writer has not after
all mistaken his vocation, were it not for
the really brilliant piece of work which
brings the volume (<i>Pegasus Comes Home</i>)
to a close. We make no apology for reproducing
this masterpiece in full:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem1">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Man comes</p>
<p class="i2">And goes.</p>
<p>What then?</p>
<p class="i2">Who knows?</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Here we have the whole philosophy
of life and the life hereafter summed up.
If he never writes another line Mr. Pinmoney
is by this assured of a permanent
place in the anthology of post-bellum
poetry.</p>

<h3>A NEWSPAPER SCOOP.</h3>

<h4>(<i>With the British Army in France.</i>)</h4>

<p>"I spotted him by the fountain-pen
stains on his vest and the thunderbolts
sticking out of his pockets," said Frederick.
"So I went up to him and said,
'You are Wuffle of <i>The Daily Hooter</i>,
the man who wiped-up Whitehall and is
now engaged in freezing-out France?"</p>

<p>"What did he say?" asked Percival.</p>

<p>"Whipped out a note-book and asked
me to tell him all about it. I said I
was pining for the white cliffs of Albion
and that the call of the counting-house
and cash-box was ringing in my ears,
but that I couldn't get demobilised because
the Colonel's pet Pomeranian had
conceived a fancy for me and wouldn't
take its underdone chop from anyone
else. I also hinted that I
and a few friends could
tell him things that would
make his biggest journalistic
scoops look like paragraphs
in a parish magazine,
so he invited me to
bring you round this afternoon
to split an infinitive
with him."</p>

<p>"Wuffle?" said Binnie.
"That's the man who
wrote about 'gilded subalterns
loafing luxuriously
in cushioned cars in a
giddy round of useless and
pampered ease'?"</p>

<p>"Well, I won't say he
wrote it, but he signed it.
No single man living could
write all the stuff Wuffle
signs. It's turned out as
they turn out cheap motor-cars.
One man roughs it
out, passes it to the adjective
department, thence to the punctuation-room,
where they sprinkle it
with commas and exclamation marks,
and then Wuffle touches it up, fits it
with headlines and signs it. Oh, I forgot.
Before it goes to press the libel
expert looks it over to see that it isn't
actionable."</p>

<p>"Anyway, he's the responsible
party," said Binnie, "and I would fain
have converse with the Wuffle. That
'gilded subaltern' bit was ringing in
my head like a dirge the other night
when I was wearily trudging the seven
kilometres from St. Denis camp because
there was no one to give me a lift."</p>

<p>That afternoon Frederick introduced
his friends to Wuffle.</p>

<p>"Sorry we're late," he said, "but
Percival and Binnie here have been
engaged with the Pioneer-Sergeant discussing
the best method of converting
a whippet-tank into a roller for the
tennis-courts."</p>

<p>At that moment a motor-lorry
rumbled by, and Binnie, recollecting a
passage in Wuffle's latest article about
"motor-lorries rushing madly about
with apparently no purpose in view,"
jumped excitedly to the door.</p>

<p>"'Magneto Maggie' leading," he
shouted, "and 'The Sparking Spitfire'
is just behind. Care to double your
bet on 'Maggie' at evens, Percival?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," replied Percival cautiously.
"It's only the first lap yet, and 'Maggie'
sometimes jibs a bit when she passes
the Remount Dep&ocirc;t."</p>

<p>Wuffle had his fountain-pen at the
alert and looked inquiringly at Frederick.</p>

<p>"I suppose it <i>is</i> another example of
deliberate waste," said the latter. "But
we've got the lorries eating their heads
off in the garages and the petrol is
simply aching to be evaporated, so we
give the drivers exercise and ourselves
some excitement over organising these
Area Circuit Steeplechases."</p>

<p>"Why not trans-ship the lorries?"
suggested Wuffle.</p>

<p>"That would never do, old prune,"
said Frederick. "The troops would
have nothing to guard."</p>

<p>"Send the men home," persisted
Wuffle.</p>

<p>"Come, my willowy asparagus," replied
Frederick in horrified tones, "we
must have troops to find us work to do.
Of course it's sometimes difficult to
keep the men employed, and then we
have to make dumps of empty biscuit
tins and things for them to guard."</p>

<p>"I fixed up a real beauty at Le Glaxo,
not ten kilometres from here," chipped
in Percival. "If you'd like to see it
there's a train going in about twenty
minutes."</p>

<p>Wuffle jumped up with alacrity.</p>

<p>"I'd be awfully glad to get a snapshot
of it," said he, disappearing in
search of his hat and coat.</p>

<p>Frederick took the opportunity to
make a few scathing remarks to Percival.</p>

<p>"It's just like you, you mouldy old
citron," he said. "I start a little experiment
in <i>tirage de jambe</i>, and you
put your heavy hoof in and spoil the
whole business. You know jolly well
that Le Glaxo was completely closed
down months ago."</p>

<p>"Oh, put another penny in your
brain-meter and try to realise that you
aren't the only one who's grown up,"
replied Percival impatiently. "Your
brain-waves move about as quick as
G.P.O. telegraph messages. I'd got
the scheme worked out while you were
putting over your old musical-comedy
gags."</p>

<p>Since the departure of
the British, Le Glaxo's
only excitement is the arrival
of its one train per
day. Ignoring the sensation
caused by the detraining
of four persons simultaneously,
Percival led his
party along a muddy rough
lane.</p>

<p>"The dump is about four
kilometres away and the
road gets rather bad towards
the end," he said,
maliciously edging Wuffle
into a bit of swamp.
"Sorry; I was going to
warn you about that."</p>

<p>Wuffle scraped mud from
his trousers and followed
the leader over a rough
wall into a hidden ditch.
A breathless climb up a
hill and a steady trudge over plough-land
found Wuffle still game, but, after
he had got his camera ready for action
on the cheerful assurance that they were
nearing their quarry, a disappointed
cry from the leader dashed his hopes.</p>

<p>"Hang it!" said Percival, "I forgot.
The dump was moved to Pont Antoine
last Tuesday. Come along; it's only
three kilometres away."</p>

<p>Strangely enough, Pont Antoine was
also a blank. Binnie suggested trying
Monceau, two kilometres further on;
but when they arrived there, fatigued
and dirty, a thin drizzle was falling and
it was almost dark. Percival confessed
himself baffled.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry," said he to
Wuffle; "I can't find it now, and the
point is how are we going to get back?
There isn't a railway for miles."</p>

<p>"Don't any of our lorries or cars
pass here?" asked Wuffle.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. But they won't give <i>you</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg 9]</span>
a lift. The orders are dead strict against
civilians riding in W.D. vehicles."</p>

<p>"It's the result of the articles in the
papers about waste," said Frederick
sympathetically. "But I don't suppose
there would be any objection to
your hanging on and running behind."</p>

<p>Wuffle looked round disconsolately.
In the gloom the lighted windows of
the tiny Hôtel de l'Univers blinked
invitingly.</p>

<p>"I think I'll stop here for the night,"
he said, "and telephone for a car to
fetch me to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Right-o!" said Percival. "And
when it's thoroughly light you might&mdash;you
<i>might</i> be able to find the dump.
So long."</p>

<p>The well-advertised series of articles
in <i>The Daily Hooter</i> commenced a few

them diligently in gleeful anticipation
of finding their contribution to journalistic
enterprise. It came at the end,
in a brief paragraph.</p>

<p>"When I had collected my material
for this powerful indictment, etc., etc."
(ran the article), "I met a party of
irresponsible subalterns bent on the old,
old army pastime of leg-pulling. For
the sake of exercise and amusement I
permitted them to conduct me on a wild-goose
chase after an imaginary dump,
which luckily led me to a sequestered
little hotel where I was able to write
my articles in peace and quietude. But
to return to the main question. I unhesitatingly
affirm..."</p>

<p>Percival, who was reading aloud, let
the paper fall limply from his hand.</p>

<p>"Frederick," he said, "put your
biggest boots on and kick me. The
word-merchant was laughing at us all
the time."</p>

<h3>THE QUESTIONABLE ALIEN.</h3>

<p>William, my hitherto unventuresome friend William, is
going abroad. I cannot be certain why. Perhaps he no
longer feels his heroism equal to the strain of living in a
country fit for heroes. It may be that he has unwittingly
incubated a bacillus which figures in novels as the "Call
of the Wild." Anyhow, William is going abroad&mdash;so much
so that, if he went any farther, he would be on his way
home again.</p>

<p>I need not say that I felt called upon to help William
through this trying period, and our preparations proceeded
satisfactorily until the clever geographers who arrange
these things nowadays discovered that William could fetch
the Far East by way of the Far West. Then the international
complications set in. First, William's passport&mdash;a
healthy enough document at the start&mdash;had to be carried
round the diplomatic quarter of London until it broke out
into a thick rash of supplementary <i>visas</i>. Next we sought
out the moneychangers in their dens, to transmute William's
viaticum bit by bit into four foreign currencies. Then a
Great Power through whose territory William will have to
pass apparently was nervous of his approach and instituted
a grand inquisition into the status and antecedents of the
Alien (William).</p>

<p>We unfolded the paper on our table and stared at it
aghast. Its area was rather less than a square yard; in
colour it favoured the yolk of bad eggs; while all over its
broad expanse were ruled compartments, half of them filled
with questions that no gentleman would ask another, the
other half left blank for William's indignant replies. We
managed with great difficulty to squeeze into the panel provided
all his baptismal titles&mdash;there are four of these besides
"William"&mdash;and then attacked the first real poser:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Are you in possession of 100 dollars, or less? If less, by
how much?</i></p>

<p>William groaned. "Reach me down Todhunter's Arithmetic,
will you?" said he.</p>

<p>I did so, and turned up the Money Market page of our
daily paper. Nothing was heard for the next five minutes
but grunts and sighs of despair. We then gave it up on
the understanding that William must make a point of
winning heavily at bridge&mdash;or would it be euchre?&mdash;on
the way across.</p>

<p><i>Have you ever been in the territory of the Great Power
before?</i></p>

<p>"No," breathed William devoutly, "and, please Heaven,
it shan't occur again!"</p>

<p><i>What is your reason for coming now?</i></p>

<p>"I suppose I'd better tell the truth," he said; "they'll
never believe me if I say I've come to put <span class="sc">Dempsey</span> up to
that right drive of <span class="sc">Carpentier's</span>."</p>

<p><i>Were you ever in prison, an almshouse, or an institution for
the treatment of the insane? If so, which?</i></p>

<p>"Take your time, William," I said; "think carefully."</p>

<p>He gave a bitter laugh. "Do they want to know <i>all</i> the
gaols and asylums I've been in," he asked, "or only the
more recent?"</p>

<p><i>Are you a polygamist?</i></p>

<p>William turned deathly pale. He then fixed me with a
terrible stare of accusation and reproach.</p>

<p>"No, no, William," I protested frantically, "I assure you
on my honour that <i>I</i> haven't been talking."</p>

<p>This assurance calmed him somewhat. Bit by bit the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span>
colour came back to his cheeks and at length he was able
to remark more hopefully: "Well, there's this to be said
for it, most of my wives are sportswomen. I don't <i>think</i>
they'll give me away."</p>

<p><i>Are you an anarchist?</i></p>

<p>"No," answered William frankly, "but I possess a
brother-in-law who has leanings towards Rosicrucianism.
Next, please."</p>

<p>The next was a very searching, legally-worded inquiry.
It demanded at great length to be informed whether William
was a person who advocated the overthrow by force or
violence of the Government of the Great Power, or all forms
of Law, or believed in the propriety of assassinating any or
every officer of the Great Power because of his official
character.</p>

<p>William took up the paper-knife with an expression of
sheer animal ferocity. "Yes," he hissed, "the whole lot.
Torturing them, too!"&mdash;and fell back into his chair with
peal upon peal of maniacal laughter.</p>

<p class="center" style="font-size: 1.4em;">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
</p>

<p>William was practically a wreck before the inquisition
came to an end. He had not even sufficient spirit left to
fly at me for entering his distinguishing marks as "a
general air of honesty, tempered by a slight inward squint."</p>

<h3>ANIMAL HELPS.</h3>

<h4>(<i>By a Student of Domestic Economy.</i>)</h4>

<p>Living in a remote country district,
where the difficulty of obtaining servants
is at present insurmountable&mdash;the
nearest "pictures" are twelve miles
off&mdash;I have been much impressed and
encouraged by two letters in recent
issues of <i>The Spectator</i>. One describes
a Bloomsbury grocer's cat that bought
her own cat's-meat; another recounts
the exploits of a spaniel belonging to
a house painter and glazier at Yarmouth
(Isle of Wight), which, if given a
penny, would immediately amble off to
a grocer's shop and purchase a cake.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:310px;"><a href="images/016-1000.png"><img src="images/016-460.png" width="310" height="460" alt="Visitor. 'How is Mrs. Brown to-day?'" /></a>

<p><i>Visitor.</i> "<span class="sc">How is Mrs. Brown to-day?</span>"</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> "<span class="sc">Well 'm, she ebbs and flows.</span>"</p></div>

<p>Viewed in their true perspective,
these exhibitions of animal intelligence
seem to indicate fruitful possibilities of
the employment of our dumb friends
to assist us in these trying times. Many
years ago I remember reading of a
baboon which discharged the duties of
a railway porter at a station in Cape
Colony with great efficiency. I have
unfortunately mislaid the reference, but
so far as I can remember no mention
was made of wages or tips; consequently
the importation and employment of
skilled simian labour on a large scale
might go a long way towards reducing
the expenses of our railway system.</p>

<p>But in view of certain obvious difficulties
it is perhaps better to restrict
our attention to the sphere of domestic
service and farm labour. And here I
would urge with all the power at my
command the employment of the elephant.
The greatest burden of household
work is the washing of plates, and
this is a task which elephants are peculiarly
well fitted to undertake; also the
cleaning of windows without the use
of a ladder. A well-trained and amiable
elephant, again, would enable parents
to dispense with a perambulator.
I admit that the initial outlay might
be considerable, but the longevity of
elephants is notorious, and it would
always be possible to hire them out to
travelling menageries.</p>

<p>Another neglected asset is the well-known
aptitude shown by poodles for
digging out truffles, an accomplishment
of which I often read in my youth. If
truffles, why not potatoes?</p>

<p>The extraordinary intelligence and
affectionate disposition of the runner
duck has often been commented on by
our serious weeklies, but so far little
attempt has been made to turn these
qualities to practical account. They
forage for themselves. Why should
they not be taught to do so for their
owners as well?</p>

<p>One more point and I have done.
Greek and Latin are going or gone, but
a modicum of Mathematics seems to be
indispensable to the modern curriculum.
The domestic pig has on many occasions
shown a capacity for mastering simple
arithmetical processes, and we know
that the pupil always ends by bettering
his master. Under a more enlightened
and humane <i>régime</i> I confidently look
forward to the time when our children
will learn the Rule of Three, not from
highly-paid and incompetent governesses,
but from unsalaried porcine instructors,
trained in the best Montessorian
methods.</p>

<h3>A LETTER TO THE BACK-BLOCKS.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Ginger</span>,&mdash;A Merry Christmas
to you! A bit late, you say? On the
contrary, in plenty of time. It is next
Christmas I am referring to. Over
there, in your tropical land, when the
sun stings your skin through your shirt
and the sand blisters your feet through
your boot-soles, when you butter your
bread with a soup-ladle and the mercury
boils merrily in the barometer,
then, vainly pawing the air for mosquitoes
with one hand and reaching for
the siphon with the other, you gasp,
"Gad! it must be getting on for Christmas-time."</p>

<p>But over here in England, where
the seasons wheel round without any
appreciable difference in temperature,
where, if it were not for the gentleman
who writes the calendars, nobody would
know whether to wear straw-hats or
snow-shoes, Christmas comes sneaking
up behind you and grabs you by
the pocket before you have time to
dodge. "Christmas Eve already!" you
exclaim. "Christmas Eve! and there's
dear old Tom in Penang and good old
Dick in Patagonia and poor old Harry
in Princetown, and I've not written a
word of cheer to any of them and now
have no time to do so." That's what
happened to me this year, anyhow; but
I'm determined it shall not occur again,
so&mdash;A Merry Christmas to you, Ginger.</p>

<p>This my first Yule in the Old Country,
after many in foreign climes, was
not an unqualified success. On the
morning of Christmas Eve I went for
a walk and lost myself. After wading
through bog systems and bramble entanglements
for some hours I came out
behind a spinney and there spied a
small urchin with red cheeks and a red
woollen muffler standing beneath a
holly-tree. On sighting me he gave
vent to a loud and piteous howl. I
asked him where his pain was, and he
replied that he wanted some holly for
decorations, but was too short to reach
it. I thereupon swarmed the shrub,
plucked and tossed the richly berried
boughs to the poor little chap. In
return he showed me where I lived&mdash;which
indeed was not two hundred
yards distant, but concealed by the
thicket.</p>

<p>Later in the day Edward came in to
tea, much annoyed. Bolshevism, he
declared, was within our gates. He had
been out to collect Christmas decorations
in his own private fenced spinney,
and confound it if some scoundrels
hadn't been and gone and stripped his
pet holly-tree of every twig! Anarchy
was yapping at the door.</p>

<p>The Aunt soothed him, saying she
had that very afternoon purchased a
supply of splendid holly from a sweet
little boy who had come round hawking
it at sixpence a bough. I asked her if
by any chance the dear little fellow had
worn a red woollen comforter, and was
not surprised when I heard that he had.</p>

<p>No sooner had I fallen asleep that
same night than I was aroused by an extraordinary
din. I lay there, comatose
and semi-conscious in the pitchy darkness,
and wondered what had happened.
Presently I distinguished the bray of
trumps, and I knew. "Golly!" I whispered
to myself, "I'm dead. Cheer-o!"
Then I recollected something I had
read concerning ye sports and customs
of ye Ancient British and decided it
must be "Waits." I crept to the
window and by a glow of lanterns
beheld the St. Gwithian Independent
Brass Band grouped round the porch,
blasting "Christians, awake!" through
their brazen fog-horns. I fumbled
about on the dressing-table, missed the
matches but found a half-crown. "Take
that and trot!" I snarled, hurling it at
them with all my strength. The coin
hit the trombone a glancing blow on the
snout, ricochetted off the bassoon and
bounded into the rockery.</p>

<p>The music stopped abruptly as the
bandsmen swarmed in pursuit of fortune.
In half-an-hour's time they had
pulled all Edward's cherished sedums
and saxifrages up by the roots and
turned over most of the smaller rocks
without discovering the treasure. A
conference in loud idiomatic Cornish
then took place, with the result that two
musicians were despatched to a neighbouring
farm for picks, crow-bars and
more lanterns; the remainder squatted
on the flower-beds and whiled away the
time of waiting by blasting "Good
King Wenceslas" to the patient stars.</p>

<p>In due course the messengers returned
and the quarrying of the rockery
began in earnest. By 4.15 <span class="sc">a.m.</span> they
had most of it littered over the drive,
but had struck some granite boulders
which defied even the crowbars. A
further conference was then held, but
at this point Edward made a dramatic
appearance, clad in lilac pyjamas, odd
boots and a kimono of the Aunt's, which
he had worn as King Alfred in some
charades the night before, and in the
darkness had donned in mistake for his
dressing-gown. His address was impassioned
and moving, but had no effect
on the Waits, who could only be persuaded
to abandon their silver mine at
the price of a second half-crown.</p>

<p>A day or so before Christmas I began
to notice that everybody was getting
presents&mdash;everybody except me, that
is. This caused me pain. It gave the
impression that I was not appreciated.
I took thought for a space, then rode
into Penzance, bought several articles
I had been wanting for some time,
wrote a few affectionate notes in disguised
handwriting, such as "With
dearest love from Flossie," "With hugs
and kisses from Ermyntrude," etc.,
enclosed them with the articles, addressed
and posted them to myself and
rode home again.</p>

<p>On Christmas morning I opened them
in public with a vast flourish, and left
the touching little dedications lying carelessly
about where anybody could read
them. From the glances of wonder and
respect which flashed at me from all
sides I gathered that everybody did.
The sensation was both novel and pleasing.
One parcel, however, there was
which I had not sent myself. It had
been forwarded on by the "Punch"
Office, marked, "Please do not crush,"
and carefully tied and sealed. My heart
leapt. "By Jove!" said I, "a genuine
Christmas present. Somebody loves me
after all. Perhaps a duchess has sent
me her tiara."</p>

<p>With trembling fingers I unlaced the
strings. The household crowded about
me, panting with envy and excitement.
Reverently I folded the multitudinous
wrappings back and revealed a very old,
very dilapidated silk slipper, severely
busted at the toe and stuffed with sticky
sweets, a small female doll, and a note&mdash;"With
all best wishes to <span class="sc">Patlander</span>
for a happy Christmas, and many thanks
for useful hints contained in <i>Punch</i>
issue, December 10th, 1919."</p>

<p>I may remind you that in the issue
mentioned was an epistle from me to
you recommending the Post as a means
of disposing of rubbish, with special
reference to worn-out foot-gear. I only
wish I knew who played this trick on
me, Ginger; I would like to give him
something in return&mdash;say an old footer-boot&mdash;with
my foot inside.</p>

<h3>THE WHAT-NOT.</h3>

<p>"Look here," I said, "this is indeed
serious. The what-not's moulting."</p>

<p>"It's been like that for a long time,"
said Anna. "But I suppose it's getting
worse."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so. And we <i>must</i> have
something reliable," I said, "to stand
dishes and things on at meals. We
can't pile them all on the table at once
like a cairn. To tell you the truth," I
added, "I've had my eye on an old
oak dresser at Smalley's for a long time.
It would be a good investment&mdash;at a
price."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Anna; "but I suppose
the price would be the earth and the
fulness thereof."</p>

<p>"That is precisely what I propose to
find out, and if they'll take anything
less than thirty pounds it's ours. In
the meantime," I added, "we'll dope
the poor old what-not with furniture
cream and see about driving it to
market."</p>

<p>There are two accepted methods of
dealing at old furniture shops. The
first is to approach them, well-groomed,
be-ringed and perfumed, smoking a
jewelled gasper and entering the shop
with a circular movement of the arm
to expose the gold wrist-watch that
<i>will</i> crawl up the sleeve at wrong moments,
and to ask in a commanding
voice, "How much is the&mdash;ah&mdash;oak-dresser&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>The presiding genius (and being a
dealer he is usually a genius), who had
really ticketed the article thirty pounds,
approaches it, removes the ticket by a
little sleight-of-hand and says, "Thirty-eight
guineas, Sir," without a blush
(the dealer who blushes is hounded from
the ring). This method of dealing is
direct action of the most dangerous
kind.</p>

<p>The other method, and the one I
most usually adopt, I can best illustrate
by detailing my interview with the
proprietor of Smalley's on the occasion
when I went dressering.</p>

<p>I sidled into the shop in garments
carefully selected from my pre-wardrobe
and wearing a vacant expression.
Picking up a piece of china I examined
it carefully, turning it upside down, as
though to search for a pottery mark,
which I probably should never have
recognised.</p>

<p>"H'm, not bad," I said.</p>

<p>"One of the best bits of Dresden
I've ever had," said the dealer. "I
want&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, German," I said, putting the
thing down hurriedly as though it
might be mined. "It may be a good
piece, but&mdash;what is the price of that
brass fender?"</p>

<p>"Seven-ten, old Dutch and a bargain,"
said the dealer laconically.</p>

<p>"But probably wouldn't fit the fireplace
in my mind. Though," I added
to myself, "it might fit the one in our
dining-room."</p>

<p>I thought it about time to notice the
dresser, not to attempt to buy it yet&mdash;oh
dear no, but merely to fire the first
shot in the campaign as it were.</p>

<p>"What kind of a dresser do you call
this?" I said. "Slightly moth-eaten,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"That's nothing; merely age. It's
Welsh," he added, "and a beauty. I
wish I could get hold of more like it.
Look at those legs; I'll guarantee you
won't&mdash;&mdash;Excuse me, Sir."</p>

<p>An immaculately dressed individual
had entered the shop, and the gentleman
trading as Smalley called an assistant
to serve him. By the time he
returned to me I had wandered far into
the recesses of the emporium and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span>
busily examining a walnut stool with a
woolwork seat.</p>

<p>"You haven't one like this in oak, I
suppose? This one," I said, "would
hardly suite my suit. That sounds
wrong, but you apprehend my meaning."</p>

<p>"I haven't," he said simply. I could
see that he was tiring rapidly, but
wasn't absolutely ripe for plucking.</p>

<p>So I priced about a dozen pieces of
china, admired several pictures and
pieces of Stuart needlework, descanted
on the beauties of a set of wheatear
chairs, pulled a small rosewood table
about until its claw and ball feet nearly
dropped off from exhaustion, and finally
led him back to the Welsh dresser.</p>

<p>"What's the price of
the Scotsman?" I said
easily, having seen thirty
guineas on the ticket
during the preliminary
examination.</p>

<p>"Twenty-nine pounds
to you," he said wearily.
He evidently knew the
strict rules of the game.</p>

<p>"But look at those
legs," I said. "They're
frightfully bent, aren't
they?"</p>

<p>"That's one of the
best features about it,"
he said. "Real Queen
Anne, those legs are."</p>

<p>"Oh, were hers like
that? I didn't know,"
I said. "Look here, I'll
give you twenty-eight
pounds, spot cash."</p>

<p>"Very well," he said.
"I like to do business."</p>

<p>"I beg pardon," said a
voice behind me, which,
in turning, I discovered
to belong to the assistant, "but that
dresser's sold. The gentleman who's
just left bought it."</p>

<p>As I was looking for the ticket (which
had disappeared), I couldn't help overhearing
the assistant's aside to his
employer.</p>

<p>"Thirty-five guineas cash," he said.</p>

<p>There is something, after all, to be
said for direct action.</p>

<p>It is a very delicate task that the
annual pantomime imposes upon Mr.
<span class="sc">Arthur Collins</span>. He has to "surpass
himself," but he must not do it once for
all or he would rob the critics of their
most cherished phrase. He reminds
me of the constructors of our Atlantic
"greyhounds," each longer by a yard or
two than the last, each swifter by a
fraction of a knot, each with a few more
tons displacement, all pronounced to
be the final word in scientific invention,
yet all reserving something for the next
time.</p>

<p>Certainly the present year marks an
advance in one respect at least&mdash;that
the grotesque and the beautiful are kept
reasonably apart; the lovely colour-scheme,
for instance, of the garden in
Fairyland is undisturbed by any element
of buffoonery. There was a revival too
of topical allusiveness after the reticence
proper to war-time; and the <span class="sc">Geddes</span>
family must be justifiably flattered by
their admission to a choric refrain.</p>

<p>The humour, of which Mr. <span class="sc">Stanley
Lupino</span> bore the brunt, was here and
there a little thin, and it is time that
somebody let the Management of Drury
Lane into the open secret that the pun,
as an instrument of mirth, has long been
a portion of the dreadful past. Mr.<span class="sc">Will
Evans</span>, as the <i>Baroness Beauxchamps</i>,
seldom let himself go, being no doubt
held in restraint by a consciousness of
his resemblance to Miss <span class="sc">Ellen Terry</span>.
Not enough chance was given to Miss
<span class="sc">Lily Long</span> (the <i>Elder Sister</i>), who has
a very nice sense of fun. As for Mr.
<span class="sc">Claff</span>, who played the operatic <i>Baron</i>,
his most humorous moment was when
he meant to be most serious. This was
in a song in praise of <i>Prince Charming</i>,
"featuring" H.R.H. in a portrait curiously
unlike the original.</p>

<p>The two most effective incidents were
borrowed from the Circus and the Halls.
Mr. <span class="sc">Du Calion</span>, who had no other very
obvious claims to play the part of a
humorous courtier, did his famous
ladder-feat&mdash;a perfectly gratuitous performance,
for, though he was supposed
to be rescuing <i>Cinderella</i> through a top-storey
window, she had the good sense
to descend by the staircase, having ignored,
as is the way of Love, the locked
door that made this impossible.</p>

<p>The other imported
business was the work of
a black horse, who preserved
an expression of
extreme gravity and detached
boredom during
the play of human wit
around his person, dissimulating
his own superior
gifts of humour
until called upon to illustrate
them with some excellent
circus-tricks.</p>

<p>On the sentimental side,
Miss <span class="sc">Marie Blanche</span>,
obedient to the inexorable
tradition that a
young hero of pantomime
must be a woman, played
<i>Prince Charming</i> with
the right manners that
makyth man; and as <i>Cinderella</i>
Miss <span class="sc">Florence
Smithson</span> once more
breathed that air of innocence
which still remains
unstaled by years of steady addiction
to the heroine habit. Her vocal intrusions,
always well received, were not
always well timed; certainly it was an
error of judgment to insert a solo at
the cross-roads after she had told us
that she hadn't a moment to spare if
she was to get home from the ball
before the rest of the family. But here
again it was a matter of obedience to
some unwritten and inscrutable law of
pantomime which it is not for us, the
profane, to question.</p>

<p>And in this spirit I tender a grateful
acknowledgment not only of the good
things that my intelligence could appreciate
in this lavish entertainment,
but also of the other things that I can
never hope to understand.</p>

<h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

<h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>

<p>"I remember, I remember...." Still on every side echoes
the poet's cry, while scarce a publisher but can prove that
the thoughts of age make long, long books. Certainly not
the shortest of these, but among the most readable, is
<i>A Medley of Memories</i> (<span class="sc">Arnold</span>), in which the Right Rev.
Sir <span class="sc">David Hunter-Blair</span> has embodied the recollections
of his very active career as Benedictine monk and a leading
figure in the world of British Catholicism. Eton, Oxford,
Rome, and (of course) his own famous monastery at Fort
Augustus, are the chief scenes of it; and about them all
Sir <span class="sc">David</span> talks vividly, even brilliantly. I am not saying
that all this pleasant garrulity would not have been the
better for the blue pencil, especially in those chapters in
which the writer's memory dwells almost to excess upon
the births, marriages, deaths and dinner-parties of the
orthodox Peerage. Elsewhere, however, Sir <span class="sc">David</span> finds
occasion in plenty for the exercise of a wit so dextrously
handled that often his thrust is delivered before you have
realized that the rapier has left its sheath. I had marked a
score of examples for quotation (and now have space for
none) and twice as many good stories. In the Oxford
recollections it was pleasant to renew my own lively
memories of a certain notorious lecture by Mr. <span class="sc">Walter
Walsh</span> on Ritualistic Societies, when violence was
narrowly averted by the tactful chairmanship of the
present <span class="sc">Lord Chancellor</span>&mdash;a lecture from which (as
Mr. <span class="sc">Belloc</span> observed at the time) "each member of the
large audience departed confirmed and strengthened in
whatever convictions he might previously have entertained."
I sincerely hope that Sir <span class="sc">David</span> has yet in store for us those
latter-day gleanings which he has been compelled to dismiss
for the present as being too recent for print.</p>

<hr />

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">G. B. Stern</span> has set himself to study with sympathy
and a candour which extenuates nothing the Jew in England
in the circumstances of war, and in particular the Jew of
German origin completely loyal to the country of his
adoption, but suspected and persecuted by such simple folk
(and journals) as are content to put their faith in equally
simple proverbs about leopards and spots. I suppose if
<i>Children of No Man's Land</i> (<span class="sc">Duckworth</span>) has a hero and
heroine you will find them in <i>Richard Marcus</i> and his sister
<i>Deborah</i>. Young <i>Richard</i>, passionately English, with all
the simple unquestioning loyalty of the public-school boy,
counts the months to the day when he can testify to this by
bearing arms in his country's defence, but finds nothing open
but internment or (by much wangling) a possible niche in
a Labour battalion. <i>Deborah's</i> adventures are chiefly of
the heart, or what passes for the heart with a common type
of modern girl anxious to wring every sensation out of life
that playing with fire can give. It does not do to betray
one's age by expressing too confidently the idea that much
of all the goings-on of <i>Deborah</i> and her friends <i>Gillian</i> and
<i>Antonia</i> seems impossible. Mr. <span class="sc">Stern</span> certainly writes as
if he knew what he was writing about, and there is so rich an
exuberance in the way he crowds his canvas, and so much
humour expressed and repressed in his point of view, that I
found this a distinctly entertaining and instructive book.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Living Bayonets: A Record of the Last Push</i> (<span class="sc">Lane</span>) is
a fourth of the enthusiastic and fiery war-books of that
eminently enthusiastic and inextinguishably fiery warrior-author,
Lieutenant <span class="sc">Coningsby Dawson</span>, of the Canadian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span>
Field Artillery. If he evinces, blatantly at times, the motives
and perspective of the propagandist, he is justified by
the fact that he most ardently practised the Hun hatred
which he preaches. He states that he enjoyed the dangers
and discomforts of so doing, and his assertion is proved to be
a true one by his having returned again and again to the
fray, notwithstanding every excuse and temptation to leave
it. The book follows on after his <i>Khaki Courage</i>, and is
also in the form of letters to his people at home. It takes
up the narrative at April 14th, 1917, and carries it to the
triumphant end. When, by reason of his wounds, he had
to leave the Front and work in London and elsewhere, he
naturally lost touch with the real business of the battle;
even after his return to the Front in April, 1918, his letters
lack their original sense of actuality, and I, reading them,
began to wonder if he was ever going to recover his former
style. Happily he does so, and with his letter of July 11th
he gives a striking
picture of a terrible
incident of war, of
which I don't remember
to have read
before, but, as I read
it now, I seem to be
witnessing it myself.
From this point on he
steadily develops his
best, so that he ends
on a fitting climax to
all his writings of the
War in his long final
letter of October 6th&mdash;propaganda
unashamed.
The book
should be thrust under
the noses of those
pacifists who now
labour to minimise
the past and to magnify
the virtue and
the value of their personal
loving-kindness.</p>

<hr />

<p>It has ever been my
misfortune that the
presence in a story of
two characters confusably
alike, or a setting
within drowning distance of a tide-race, will produce in me
an almost insuperable sense of its having been "made on
purpose." I had therefore a double stroke of bad luck in finding
both these elements present in <i>The Splendid Fairing</i>
(<span class="sc">Mills and Boon</span>). But the more credit to Miss <span class="sc">Constance
Holme</span> that, despite my increasing conviction that the
wrong prodigal would return, and that the powers of nature
were throughout almost visibly preparing to engulf him,
the gentle and unforced power of her story did hold my
attention till the final wave. Distinction shown in apparent
absence of effort would, I think, be my verdict on her
writing; she clearly knows her Northern farmer-folk with
the sympathy of intimate experience. I hope I have not
already suggested too much of the plot, a little tragedy of
the commonplace dealing with the relations between two
farming brothers, of whom the younger prospers while the
elder fails, and the life-long jealousies of their women.
Miss <span class="sc">Holme</span> works, one may say, on a minute scale; the
short but simple annals of the poor interest her to the extent
of providing an entire volume of three hundred odd
pages from the events of a single day. But though now
and then the old Northern counsel to "get eendways wi'
it" does hover in the background of one's mind I repeat
that sincerity carries the thing through. For all that, however,
<i>The Splendid Fairing</i> did but confirm me in a previous
impression that these Mary-call-the-cattle-home localities
must remain more convenient to the local colourist than
attractive to the inhabitants.</p>

<hr />

<p>The publication, as a foreword, of a "Glossary of Native
Words" used in the text made me wonder whether I
should be bored or instructed, or both, by <i>The Death Drum</i>
(<span class="sc">Hurst and Blackett</span>). Most happily I was neither.
Miss <span class="sc">Margaret Peterson</span> has built her novel, perhaps a
trifle hastily, about a quite uncommon theme and given it,
in Uganda, a quite uncommon setting. It is the story of
a half-caste who marries a white girl in order to avenge,
in her degradation, his sister whom the English girl's
brother had betrayed.
I must not say that
<i>Tom Davis</i>, the half-caste,
is too much a
white man&mdash;for Miss
<span class="sc">Peterson</span>, to do her
justice, has distributed
goodness and badness
among her blacks and
whites with a quite
impartial hand&mdash;but
he is too fine a fellow
to carry out his own
plan, and, before he
has done any lasting
harm to the girl he
has come to love, he
takes himself, by way
of a native rising, to
a lotus-covered lake,
and so out of her life.
It seems a pity that
the happiness of the
story's end couldn't
include <i>Tom</i>, but his
ancestry effectually
barred the way, and
Miss <span class="sc">Peterson</span> has
had to rely upon a
very strong and not
quite silent Englishman
of the best type for her satisfactory finish.</p>

<hr />

<p>Few authors have a shrewder idea than Mr. <span class="sc">P. G. Wodehouse</span>
of what the British and American public want in
the way of humour, and I do not know anyone more determined
to supply their requirements. He would be a dull
fellow indeed who did not appreciate the high spirits and
humorous situations to be found in <i>A Damsel in Distress</i>
(<span class="sc">Jenkins</span>). It is no small feat to maintain a riot of irresponsible
fun for more than three hundred pages, but Mr.
<span class="sc">Wodehouse</span> gets going at once, and keeps up the pace to
the end without even a pause to get his second wind. If
some of the characters&mdash;a ridiculous peer, his more ridiculous
sister and his most ridiculous butler&mdash;are of the "stock"
variety, Mr. <span class="sc">Wodehouse's</span> way of treating them is always
fresh and amusing. But in his next frolic I beseech him to
give golf and its tiresome lingo a complete rest.</p>
